**This plugin is no longer supported**

Add options to the user profile pages to set the post/page background and border color for each user.
See [the screenshots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/author-color/screenshots/ "screenshots") about what to expect.

It works only for themes that use [post_class](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/post_class "post_class").
A well written theme should use this template tag.
